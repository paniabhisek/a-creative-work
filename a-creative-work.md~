I did not want to put it online for various reasons. One of them is very personal. Next, I do not know if any benefit will come out of it. Since I consider this as my best work, I did not want to put it online because it might not have reached the right person who would have been inspired by it. So I wanted to keep it for myself. I am putting it up now in the hope that more people will benefit from it.</br></br>

In February 2020, I have made the following action. I do not remember the exact date. The number of stars for which I took action could be reached on February 14, or it could be a later date.</br></br>

My [AlexNet](https://github.com/paniabhisek/AlexNet") repository had thirty six stars. I was following few people and I had ten followers. When I searched my name on Google, I got some results. One is my hackerrank page. And others could be my Github and/or Linkedin. When I searched my GitHub page and my name on Google, I just wanted to do this. I made three of my repositories private: AlexNet, VGG, and Movie Recommendation System. Because those are the big projects out of others at that time. Then I unfollowed whomever I was following. One of the person I was following happens to be Muslim. I understand that religion is a sensitive topic. But, this is here only to demonstrate the beauty of the work. Then I removed the profile picture of my GitHub page. Then I changed the username and profile picture of my HackerRank page to iamjoker and The Dark Knight Joker picture respectively. There are other things that I did which are not required for showcasing the work.


## What is it?

One is to trade the number of followings with the number of stars I had for those three repositories. So I follow zero people. Another one is the most beautiful. It is neither visual nor written. One of the element is the picture of The Dark Knight Joker. But the picture is nothing in itself. Another one is the number thirty six, a woman's private body part size. Which is traditionally regarded as the perfect female body part size. To see the beauty of the creative work, you need to think of the action happening while making changes to GitHub page and to the picture of the HackerRank page. You can find so many meanings while you are thinking on the action. Some of them are, leaving behind a bad character, easier to attract women when you are funny, taking leadership, putting a mask for the outerworld, preparing for new opportunities.

## How did I come up with this?

There is one detail which might be useful but is very private. I will probably include this for later stage in my life. If you are reading this please do not ask me.</br></br>


## Closing

Later, I lied to one of the forked github member to transfer the ownership. Because I did not want to say what I did and appear not to come across as disrespectful to whoever that have supported my Github repositories.
